# Docker-ELDA

This docker deploys the Elda system.

[Elda](https://github.com/epimorphics/elda) is a Java implementation of the Linked Data API, which provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint. The API developer (probably you) writes an API spec (in RDF) which specifies how to translate URLs into queries.

## build the docker

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tenforce/docker-elda
docker build -t docker-elda .
```

You can choose a specific version of ELDA and pass it as an argument (default: `1.3.23`).

```
docker build -t docker-elda . --build-arg version=1.3.23
```
